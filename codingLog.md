### 2025-11-29 19:05 - Align frontend proxy port
- Files: `frontend/vite.config.ts`
- Summary: Updated Vite dev proxy port to match backend uvicorn startup.
- Reason: Avoid socket hang up errors during register API calls.
- Impact: Frontend /api and /uploads requests now reach running backend.
- Scope: Dev server proxy configuration only; build output unchanged.
- Risk: Assumes backend continues to run on 127.0.0.1:8001.
- Mitigation: Adjust backend start script or proxy target together if port changes.
- Test: Not run (verify by starting frontend and registering).
- FollowUp: Validate registration flow after restarting dev server.
- Config: No environment variables were changed.
- Notes: Both API and uploads proxies now point to the same backend port.
- Compatibility: Matches current start_backend.bat uvicorn port configuration.
- TODO: Add guardrails to detect proxy/backend port mismatches automatically.
